               <h1>The UNIX Environment</h1>
               <br>
               <p>Unix is a family of computer operating systems that are deived from the original AT&T Unix. There are a number of popular systems based on Unix, including Apple's OS and Linux variants. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Wikipedia article</a> on Unix continues to describe a unique attribute of Unix systems: </p>
               <br>
               <blockquote>
                   From the power user's or programmer's perspective, Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy," meaning the OS <b>provides a set of simple tools that each perform a limited, well-defined function, with a unified filesystem as the main means of communication and a shell scripting and command language to combine the tools to perform complex workflows</b>. Aside from the modular design, Unix also distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: <b>virtually the entire OS is written in the C programming language</b> which allowed it to outgrow the 16-bit PDP-11 minicomputer for which it was originally developed.
               </blockquote>
               <br>
               <p>As it is extremely portable and capable of complex workflows, Unix systems are often used as servers, including in this course. This course site will seek to establish some base guidelines for using Unix systems for that purpose.
